description: |
  There is a Python script named `unwanted_process` running in the background. Your task is to identify and terminate this process using appropriate Linux commands.
difficulty: easy
points: 15
category: "linux, process-management"
solution: |
  To complete this challenge, you need to identify and kill the process named `unwanted_process`. Here are the steps to achieve this:
  1. Open a terminal in the challenge environment.
  2. Use the `ps` command to list all running processes and find the PID of `unwanted_process`:
      ```bash
      ps aux | grep unwanted_process
      ```
  3. Once you have the PID, use the `kill` command to terminate the process:
      ```bash
      kill <PID>
      ```
      Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID you found in the previous step.
  4. Verify that the process has been terminated by running the `ps` command again
      ```bash
      ps aux | grep unwanted_process
      ```
      You should not see `unwanted_process` listed in the output, indicating that the process has been successfully killed.
