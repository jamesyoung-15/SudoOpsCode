title: Find the DNS Server
description: |
  A fake DNS configuration file has been created at `/home/challenger/network_info/resolv.conf`.
  Your task is to determine the **primary DNS server** (the first `nameserver` entry)
  and write it to `/tmp/dns_found`.

  The DNS is the first nameserver line. For example, you can use:

  ```bash
  cat /home/challenger/network_info/resolv.conf | grep "nameserver"
  ```
  Then write the first nameserver to the output file:

  ```bash
  echo "8.8.8.8" > /tmp/dns_found
  ```
