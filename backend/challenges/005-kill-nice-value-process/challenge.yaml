title: Kill the Process with a Nice Value
description: |
  Two Python processes are running with different nice values.  
  One of them has a nice value of **10**.  
  Your task is to locate and terminate only the process with that nice value.

solution: |
  1. List processes and show their niceness:
      ```bash
      ps -eo pid,ni,comm
      ```

      or add `grep 10` and find the second column showing `10`:

      ```bash
      ps -eo pid,ni,comm | grep " 10 "
      ```

  2. Identify the one with NI=10.
  3. Kill it using:
      ```bash
      kill <PID>
      ```
  4. Ensure the other process is still running.
