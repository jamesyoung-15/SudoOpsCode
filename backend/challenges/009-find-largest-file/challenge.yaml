  You can use the `ls` command with sorting to find the largest file:

  ```bash
  ls -S /home/challenger/size_test
  ```

  The largest file will be the first in the list. Write its full path to the output file:

  ```bash
  echo "/home/challenger/size_test/b.bin" > /tmp/largest_found
  ```

order: 9
