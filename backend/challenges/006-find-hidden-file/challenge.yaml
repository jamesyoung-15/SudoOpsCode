description: |
  A deep directory tree has been created with many files.  
  One of these files contains the text `FLAG: success`.  
  Your task is to locate this file, then write the word `FOUND` into it to prove you located it.
  Hint: You can use commands like `find` or `grep` to help with your search.

  1. Use `find` to search for the file:
      ```bash
      find /home/challenger/search_challenge -type f -name "secret_file.txt"
      ```
  2. Or search by content:
      ```bash
      grep -R "FLAG: success" /home/challenger/search_challenge
      ```
  3. Append the tag:
      ```bash
      echo FOUND >> /path/to/secret_file.txt
      ```
